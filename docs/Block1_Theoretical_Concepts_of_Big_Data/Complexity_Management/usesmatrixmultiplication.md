# Other Uses of Matrix Multiplication in Big Data (Beyond Graphs)

## Machine Learning and Deep Learning
- **Neural network training**: each layer performs matrix multiplication operations (weights × inputs).  
- **Example**: in an embedding-based recommendation model, products and users are represented as vectors, and similarity is computed through matrix multiplications.  

## Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- **Vector representations** (word embeddings, BERT, transformers): require millions of matrix multiplication operations to compute attention and contextual relationships.  
- **Example**: the *self-attention* mechanism in transformers is based on matrix multiplications between queries, keys, and values.  

## Image and Signal Processing
- In computer vision, **convolutions** can be represented as matrix multiplications between an image and filters.  
- In Big Data, this is applied to process large-scale image collections (e.g., facial recognition in massive datasets).  

## Matrix Factorization in Recommendation Systems
- Techniques such as **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)** or **Matrix Factorization** decompose large matrices (users × items) into products of smaller matrices.  
- This allows for uncovering hidden patterns and predicting ratings.  

## Scientific Simulations and Bioinformatics
- In **molecular dynamics, climatology, or genomics**, huge matrices are used to represent interactions.  
- The system’s evolution is simulated through successive matrix multiplications.
