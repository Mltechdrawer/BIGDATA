# Other Uses of Matrix Multiplication in Big Data (Beyond Graphs)

## Machine Learning and Deep Learning
- **Neural network training**: each layer performs matrix multiplication operations (weights × inputs).  
- **Example**: in an embedding-based recommendation model, products and users are represented as vectors, and similarity is computed through matrix multiplications.

<p><b>Neural network training:</b> each layer performs matrix multiplication between <i>weights</i> and <i>inputs</i> to compute the activations.  
For example, in a layer with weight matrix <i>W</i> and input vector <i>X</i>, the output is <i>Y = W × X + b</i>, where <i>b</i> is the bias term.</p>
<p><b>Example:</b> In an embedding-based recommendation model, users and products are represented as vectors in a latent space.  
If <i>U</i> is the user embedding matrix (each row represents a user) and <i>P</i> is the product embedding matrix (each row a product),  
the similarity or affinity between users and products is computed as <i>S = U × Pᵀ</i>,  
where <i>S<sub>ij</sub></i> expresses how much user <i>i</i> is predicted to like product <i>j</i>.</p>

## Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- **Vector representations** (word embeddings, BERT, transformers): require millions of matrix multiplication operations to compute attention and contextual relationships.  
- **Example**: the *self-attention* mechanism in transformers is based on matrix multiplications between queries, keys, and values.

<p><b>Vector representations:</b> (word embeddings, BERT, transformers) require millions of matrix multiplication operations to compute attention and contextual relationships between tokens. Each word or token is represented as a numerical vector in a high-dimensional space.</p>
<p><b>Example:</b> In the <i>self-attention</i> mechanism of transformers, three matrices are computed: Queries (Q), Keys (K), and Values (V).  
The attention scores are calculated through matrix multiplications as follows:  
<i>Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax((Q × Kᵀ) / √d<sub>k</sub>) × V</i>  
This allows each token to attend to others according to their contextual relevance, forming the core of models like BERT and GPT.</p>

## Image and Signal Processing
- In computer vision, **convolutions** can be represented as matrix multiplications between an image and filters.  
- In Big Data, this is applied to process large-scale image collections (e.g., facial recognition in massive datasets).

<summary>Image and Signal Processing</summary>
<p><b>In computer vision,</b> <i>convolutions</i> can be represented as matrix multiplications between an image (a matrix of pixel values) and small filters or kernels.  
Each convolution operation slides the filter across the image, performing local matrix multiplications to extract features such as edges, colors, or textures.</p>
<p><b>In Big Data,</b> this approach is used to process large-scale image collections — for instance, in facial recognition systems or automatic image classification across massive datasets.</p>

## Matrix Factorization in Recommendation Systems
- Techniques such as **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)** or **Matrix Factorization** decompose large matrices (users × items) into products of smaller matrices.  
- This allows for uncovering hidden patterns and predicting ratings.

## Scientific Simulations and Bioinformatics
- In **molecular dynamics, climatology, or genomics**, huge matrices are used to represent interactions.  
- The system’s evolution is simulated through successive matrix multiplications.

<p><b>In fields such as</b> <i>molecular dynamics, climatology, or genomics</i>, large matrices are used to represent complex interactions among system components — such as forces between atoms, correlations between genes, or environmental variables.</p>
<p><b>The system’s evolution</b> is simulated through successive matrix multiplications, which update the state of the model over time.  
This enables the study of complex phenomena such as protein folding, mutation propagation, or large-scale climate patterns.</p>
