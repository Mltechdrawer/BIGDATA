## üìä Big Data

**Big Data** is a compulsory course of the 3rd year in the **Degree in Data Science and Engineering** (1st semester, 6 ECTS). It provides students with the theoretical foundations and practical skills to design, implement, and analyse data-intensive applications that are reliable, scalable, and maintainable.

The course combines theory, practical exercises, and laboratory sessions. Weekly activities are closely related to the theoretical content, reinforcing knowledge through a group project with iterative development and presentations. Students will acquire essential competences in parallel programming, distributed systems, and performance engineering ‚Äî all key skills for modern data engineering and analytics.

The learning approach emphasises **individual and team work**, fostering the ability to apply theoretical concepts to real-world Big Data problems. This course serves as a solid foundation for advanced subjects related to distributed systems, cloud computing, and large-scale machine learning.
